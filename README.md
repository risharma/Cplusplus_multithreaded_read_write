# Cplusplus_multithreaded_read_write
The application 'main.cxx' performs the following functions:

a) It reads a list of ASCII words from STDIN, a word per input
line, terminated by the word 'end'.

b) It removes the duplicates, sorts the words alphabetically,
and prints them with the number of how many times each word
was encountered.

c) Then it repeatedly asks the user to enter a word and tries to
look it up in the word list which was entered initially. It
terminates when it encounters EOF.
